# Memory Access
The internal memory in the Ice40 FPGA is known as Block RAM or BRAM. There is 16kb of it in 32 banks of 512 bytes.

Yosys deduces when BRAM can be used. Memory blocks are typically defined like:

```
reg [7:0] mem [0:MAX_INDEX];
```

But it does not need to be in bytes, the 7 can be replaced by other maximum indexes for the number of bits in each unit. Not all declarations of this sort are mapped to BRAM. It depends on how it is accessed.

There are a few design patterns that are frequently used, that will be reliably mapped to BRAM.

## ROM
A read only memory in BRAM can be programmed as:
```verilog
module rom myrom (
    output reg [7:0] dout,
    input[12:0] address,
    input clk
);

parameter MEM_INIT_FILE = "rom.hex";
reg [7:0] rom [0:8191];
initial
    if (MEM_INIT_FILE != "")
    $readmemh(MEM_INIT_FILE, rom);

    always @(posedge clk)
        dout <= rom[address];
endmodule
```
Sometimes instead of initialising the ROM from a hex or binary file, a switch statement is used to explicitly define the values at each address.

## Dual Ported RAM
Dual ported RAM used for video memory or other uses, can be programmed as follows:

```verilog
module vid_ram (
    // Port A
    input clk_a,
    input we_a,
    input [12:0] addr_a,
    input [7:0] din_a,
    // Port B
    input clk_b,
    input [12:0] addr_b,
    output reg [7:0] dout_b
);

parameter MEM_INIT_FILE = "vid_ram.mem";

reg [7:0] ram [0:6143];
initial
    if (MEM_INIT_FILE != "") $readmemh(MEM_INIT_FILE, ram);

    always @(posedge clk_a)
    begin
        if (we_a)
            ram[addr_a] <= din_a;
        end

    always @(posedge clk_b)
    begin
        dout_b <= ram[addr_b];
    end
endmodule
```

Sometimes the clock used for reading and writing the memory is the same and a single clock parameter can be used.

## SRAM
In addition to BRAM, the BlackIce II has 512kb of external static ram or SRAM. This must be accessed explicitly using a set of dedicated address, data and control pins. The BlackIce SRAM example shows how this is done. SRAM is not dual-ported so only one access can be made to it in any clock cycle â€“ either read or write.

SRAM is usually accessed in 16-bit words, but the pines RAM_UB or RAM_LB can be used to read or write a single byte.

The maximum address for the SRAM is 256k, which requires 18 bits.

## Memory Mapping
SoCs and soft processors typically access hardware by memory mapping. So when the soft processor issues a memory access, a Verilog module examines the address and decides whether to map it to SRAM or BRAM or to interpret it as an a read or write to other hardware.

In the latter case it will usually pass the address and data (in the case of writes) to another module to access the required hardware. A flag from that module will normally indicate when the access is complete or when an asynchronous access has been started and the soft processor memory access can then complete. It may take several clock cycles.
